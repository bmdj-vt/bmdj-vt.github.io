Congrats to Casie Peng and Kim Giordano for winning the 2nd place research award at VTURCS for their project "Transparency of Virtual Reality Sensors’ Usage and Exploitation"! The students are co-advised by Dr. Bo Ji and Professor Margaret Ellis through the BURGs program. This work continues the PrivateEye Lab award winning streak at VTURCS started in Spring 2023!
