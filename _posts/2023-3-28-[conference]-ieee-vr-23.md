The PrivateEye lab had a wonderful time at the IEEE VR 2023 VT satellite conference. Many thanks to Jerald Thomas, Joe Gabbard, and Doug Bowman for organizing the event. In case you missed it, check out the 9 minute presentation video of "Privacy-preserving datasets of eye-tracking samples with applications in XR" on the [privacy datasets project page](https://bmdj-vt.github.io/project_pages/privacy_datasets)!
