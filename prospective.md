title: Prospective Students
---

I am interested in hardworking and creative students primarily for projects related to XR, eye tracking, and privacy. Relevant skillsets include (but are not limited to): conducting user studies in virtual or augmented reality, visual perception and eye tracking, computer graphics or computer vision, and privacy or security. My research areas are multi-disciplinary in nature, meaning skills from a non-traditional CS background may be applicable to our lab projects.

### Graduate Students

Graduate students interested in enrolling in the CS department at VT must apply by the appropriate deadline. Existing students should contact me with their CV and clearly state their research objectives and how their interests relate to existing lab projects. Please also provide a **_brief 4-5 sentence_** description of how you could inspire a new project in the lab or contribute to an existing research project from the Projects page.



### Undergraduate Students

I am excited to recruit undergraduate students to support research projects in the future. Undergraduate roles and time commitment vary based on research interests and prior experience of the student. Interested students from diverse backgrounds and departments are especially encouraged to reach out. Please contact me with an up to date resume, link to website or project portfolio (if applicable), and a brief paragraph describing your research interests and motivation behind joining the lab. A successful initial project or independent study could lead to further collaborations and paid research positions.
